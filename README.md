Flappy Bird Game in Java
This is a Java-based Flappy Bird game created using JPanel for the game rendering and basic game logic.
The player controls a bird by pressing the spacebar to fly through gaps between vertically moving pipes.
The goal is to navigate the bird through the pipes without colliding, while scoring points for every pair of pipes passed.

Features:
Smooth Animations: The game runs at 60 FPS using a timer-based update loop.

Simple Controls: Press the spacebar to make the bird "flap" and ascend; release to let gravity bring the bird down.

Score Tracking: Points are awarded for each pipe successfully passed.

Game Over Mechanic: The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or falls below the screen. A Game Over message is displayed along with the final score.

ted with a vertical gap, creating dynamic and challenging gameplay.
Game Mechanics:

Gravity and Velocity: The bird descends due to gravity and can flap upwards by pressing the spacebar.

Collision Detection: Collision is detected between the bird and the pipes, causing the game to end.

Restart Functionality: After the game over, press space to restart with the bird in its initial position.
Installation and Usage:

Clone the repository or download the source code.
